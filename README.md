# StockPredictionMachineLearning
Stock prediction algorithms that feature deep learning techniques. The ensemble algorithm features preprocessing of data using matrix profiles, vector time-embeddings, regime-shift indices, and outlier detection. Additional techniques such as meta-labeling and threshold-based predictions improved the f1 scores above 70% on a multitude of different assets. The meta model consisted of a bayesian LSTM, and the ensemble comprised of tree classifers, SVM, KNN, neural networks, gradient boosters, logistic regression, and FB Prophet. Finally, portfolio allocation was calculated via the Black-Litterman model provided weights from the ensemble. Data is sourced from quandl, yahoo finance, and pandas data-reader.
